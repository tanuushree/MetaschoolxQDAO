# Gamer DAO

This project was created as part of a workshop in collaboration with Metaschool, focusing on decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) development with an Airdrop feature. The DAO is deployed on the Q Blockchain's testnet.

## Overview

The Gamer DAO operates on Q Blockchain and has its own ERC20 Token, called QRC20 Token, which is based on Ethereum's ERC-20 standard. This token adheres to fungibility rules, enabling users to create, approve, and manage transfers within the ecosystem.

## Features

### QRC20 Token

The QRC20 Token is the native token of the Gamer DAO, built on Ethereum's ERC-20 standard. It embodies fungible tokens with similar structure and functionality, facilitating seamless transactions within the DAO.

### Airdrop Module

The Airdrop Module is a distinctive feature tailored for the Gamer DAO. Unlike conventional airdrops, it serves as a mechanism for distributing tokens to DAO members, fostering user adoption, and rewarding existing token holders. This module plays a pivotal role in incentivizing participation and engagement within the Gamer DAO community.
